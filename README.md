This mod is an add-on to Tinkers' Construct for 1.16 and adds new weapons, materials, and traits.

![Weapons and materials](web/images/new-1.4-alpha.png "New weapons and materials")

## Weapons
* **Mace** - Bonks enemies with increased knockback.
* **Naginata** - It's a knife on a long stick.
* **War Hammer**  - Powerful but slow. Right-click the ground to blast enemies away. Compatible with other abilities and upgrades:
   * Haste: reduced cooldown
   * Blasting: increased height
   * Knockback: increased distance
   * Range: increase AOE

## Materials
Three new materials, all created with the Tinkers Smeltery. Alas poor Yorick, you'll need to use JEI to discover them and learn their recipes.

## Traits
* **Liftoff** - Knocks nearby enemies up, up, and away when you strike the ground with it.
* **Vengeful** - The more kills you make with a tool, the higher the attack damage bonus.

## Configurations
- `vengefulDamageCap` applies a cap to the damage bonus for a weapon with Vengeful trait. Default is 0 (no cap).

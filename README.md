This mod is an add-on to Tinkers' Construct for 1.16, and is a work-in-progress. It currently adds a new weapon, three new materials, and one new trait.

## Weapons
**Mace** - Bonks enemies with increased knockback. Requires a mace head, tool handle, and tool binding.

## Materials
Three new materials, all created with the Tinkers Smeltery. Alas poor Yorick, you'll need to use JEI to discover them and learn their recipes.

## Traits
**Vengeful** - The more kills you make with a tool, the higher the attack damage bonus.
